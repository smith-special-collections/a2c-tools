This is code to publish any unpublished linked agents for a list of resources. In order to run, the repository number (e.g., 2) and a list of space-delimited resources (e.g., 756 834 etc.) must be passed to the command line as arguments.

Example of command to run the program on the command line:

'''
python3 resource_agents.py local 2 756 804 810
'''
