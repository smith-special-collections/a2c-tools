This code matches PDF file names to the Archival Object record on component_id and then, if none exists, creates an Other Finding Aid note with a link out to the PDF on a server. It then adds an Other Finding Aid note to the Archival Object's parent Resource record. The match is made on the file name. The script requires the file path to the PDF directory to be added as a command line argument. The PDF directory is structured into folders, the names of which are Resource component_ids. It connects to the ArchivesSpace instance via archivesspace.cfg. Dependencies: ArchivesSpace module v0.0.6. 

Script requires a file generated by a SQL query (such as the one below) to match folder titles against Resource component_ids:

```
SELECT title as 'title',
identifier as 'accession_id',
CONCAT('/repositories/', repo_id, '/resources/', id) as uri
FROM resource
WHERE identifier IS NOT NULL
```
